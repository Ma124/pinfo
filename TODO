(1) Clean up the manual code as much as possible; it's still giving
	valgrind errors, which is BAD.
(2) Fix parse_config.cxx 's use of strtok.
    And wipe out all other uses of strtok.

Sigh.  The easy string conversions are done; the hard ones remain.

(medium term)
(1) Squelch all negative-integer issues.  (Sigh.)  This is probably best
		done by changing return values to use a struct or some such.
(2) Put a C++ wrapper around ncurses.

Arrr.  I've broken the manual code when
used with narrow narrow windows.  Well,
actually it was already broken; I just broke
it *more*.

(long term)
Fix temp file usage better.  Ideally, we would open a file, keep a handle to
it, and refer only to the handle.  But how do we pass a filehandle to a
system() call?

Unify manual and info code.
